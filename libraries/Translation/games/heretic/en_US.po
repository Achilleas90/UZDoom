"plane of existence.\n"
"\n"
"Those creatures had to come from\n"
"somewhere, though, and you have the\n"
"sneaky suspicion that the fiery\n"
"portal of hell's maw opens onto\n"
"their home dimension.\n"
"\n"
"To make sure that more undead\n"
"(or even worse things) don't come\n"
"through, you'll have to seal Hell's\n"
"maw from the other side. Of course\n"
"this means you may get stuck in a\n"
"very unfriendly world, but no one\n"
"ever said being a heretic was easy!"

"The mighty maulotaurs have proved\n"
"to be no match for you, and as\n"
"their steaming corpses slide to the\n"
"ground you feel a sense of grim\n"
"satisfaction that they have been\n"
"destroyed.\n"
"\n"
"The gateways which they guarded\n"

"the maulotaurs? Could there be even\n"

msgstr ""
"You thought you would return to your\n"
"own world after D'Sparil died, but\n"
"his final act banished you to his\n"
"own plane. Here you entered the\n"
"shattered remnants of lands\n"
"conquered by D'Sparil. You defeated\n"
"the last guardians of these lands,\n"
"but now you stand before the gates\n"
"to d'Sparil's stronghold. Until this\n"
"moment you had no doubts about your\n"
"ability to face anything you might\n"
"encounter, but beyond this portal\n"
"lies the very heart of the evil\n"
"which invaded your world. D'Sparil\n"
"might be dead, but the pit where he\n"
"was spawned remains. Now you must\n"
"enter that pit in the hopes of\n"
"finding a way out. And somewhere,\n"
"in the darkest corner of D'Sparil's\n"
"demesne, his personal bodyguards\n"
"await your arrival ..."

"death-agony, you realize that you\n"
"have never come so close to your own\n"
"destruction. Not even the fight with\n"
"D'Sparil and his disciples had been\n"
"this desperate. Grimly you stare at\n"
"the gates which open before you,\n"
"wondering if they lead home, or if\n"
"they open onto some undreamed-of\n"
"horror. You find yourself wondering\n"
"if you have the strength to go on,\n"
"if nothing but death and pain await\n"
"you. But what else can you do, if\n"
"the will to fight is gone? Can you\n"
"force yourself to continue in the\n"
"face of such despair? Do you have\n"
"the courage? You find, in the end,\n"
"that it is not within you to\n"
"surrender without a fight. Eyes\n"
"wide, you go to meet your fate."
