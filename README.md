**UZDoom** is a modern, feature-rich source port for the classic game **DOOM**.

A continuation of ZDoom and GZDoom, UZDoom enhances the original DOOM engine, providing advanced features like:

* High-Resolution Graphics
* Dynamic lighting
* 3D Floors
* Extensive Modding Support
* Support for modern OpenGL and Vulkan renderers

UZDoom is **free and open-source software**, built and maintained by a dedicated community of developers and enthusiasts.

* **Marisa Heit** for her foundational work on ZDoom, and **Christoph Oelckers** for his work on GZDoom.
* The countless modders, mappers, and artists in the DOOM community who continue to create amazing content.
* All the contributors who have submitted code, reported bugs, and helped improve the project over the years.
